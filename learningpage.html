            IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Use VARK to tailor your learning to your method of learning.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Project Work — </b>Start a zero based project example and write comments in your code for future
            reference. </li> <br>

    <!-- 3 - Good Fundamentals and Careers -->
    <h2>Good Fundamentals and Careers</h2>
    <p>There are lots of different jobs in the industry, but most of them have common fundamentals. Web developers use
        programming languages to build websites and web applications. A good grasp of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is
        important, as they are the building blocks of websites. You should also know that there are libraries of code
        already written for developers to pick up and expand on. The vast majority of new websites are not built from
        scratch, they are built on top of a basic platform. You don't have to know how to use these libraries but you
        should have a basic understanding of what they are.</p>
    <p><b>How to think like a programmer? — </b>problem solving and approach behind it → from Problem to Solution</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Front-end — </b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, DOM, Frameworks | client and browser</li> <br>
        <li><b>Back-end — </b>Java, Python, C#, SQL, MongoDB, Object-oriented Programming | server and databases</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Full-stack — </b>Combination of both front-end and back-end</li> <br>
        <li><b>Data Scientist — </b>Data Science combines a range of skills to analyse data collected from the web,
            smartphones, customers, sensors, and other sources to derive actionable insights. Data science encompasses
            preparing data for analysis, including cleansing, aggregating, and manipulating the data to perform advanced
            data analysis. Analytic applications and data scientists can then review the results to uncover patterns and
            enable business leaders to draw informed insights.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>User Interface (UI) & User experience (UX) — </b> UX is focused on the user’s journey to solve a problem,
            UI is focused on how a product’s surfaces look and function. A UX designer is concerned with the conceptual
            aspects of the design process, leaving the UI designer to focus on the more tangible elements. There is no
            difference between UX and UI design because they are two things that aren’t comparable to each other. UI is
            the bridge that gets us where we want to go, UX is the feeling we get when we arrive. UI is focused on the
            product, a series of snapshots in time. UX focuses on the user and their journey through the product. </li>

    <!-- 4 - Your Learning Style -->
    <h2>Your Learning Style</h2>
    <p>The VARK model of learning styles suggests that there are four main types of learners: <em>visual, auditory,
            reading/writing, and kinesthetic</em>. Adapting your learning method to your prefered learning style can
        help you understand concepts better. People might find that understanding their own learning preferences can be
        helpful. If you know that visual learning appeals to you most, using visual study strategies in conjunction with
        other learning methods might help you remember and enjoy your studies more. If no single learning preference
        calls out to you or you change preferences based on the situation or the type of information you are learning,
        you probably have what is known as a multimodal style.</p>
    <a id="vark" href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/" target="_blank">The VARK Questionnaire</a>
    <ul>
        <li><b>(V) Visual Learner — </b>(pictures, movies, diagrams) Try creating a Mindmap or flowchart of the concepts
            this will help you see how they fit into the overall bigger picture.</li> <br>
        <li><b>(A) Auditory Learner — </b>(music, discussion, lectures) Watch the YouTube videos above to learn
            concepts, create mnemonics to remember things! </li> <br>
        <li><b>(R) Reading and writing Learner — </b>(making lists, reading textbooks, taking notes) Create a list of
            key terms and review them. Write notes out by hand to consolidate what you have learnt. </li> <br>
        <li><b>(K) Kinesthetic Learner — </b>(movement, experiments, hands-on activities) Write concepts on post-it
            notes and move them place them on your wall to see links and connections.</li> <br>
    </ul>

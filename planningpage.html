            <dd>I advise all self-taught developers to create a Coding Handbook, as it will help keep you accountable
                and provide you with the structure to follow to tutor yourself. Creating a habit and the discipline to
                your studies. Organise notes by the programming language and add subsections for ease of use and note
                them all in an Index. Include a Key Terms page to refer back to the definitions of key concepts. Reflect
                on yesterday's tasks by writing your achievements in a journal to help boost your confidence in your
                ability. Follow a structured course helps you know what to learn and when to learn. Have a schedule and
                remember to always take breaks away from the computer. Going for a walk helps reduce mental fatigue and
                burnout. Maybe try #100DaysToCode challenge on social media to help keep you acountable. Have a handy
                cheatsheet with key code samples.

            <dt>The Pomodoro Technique</dt>
            <dd>This popular time management method asks you to alternate pomodoros - focused work sessions - with
                frequent short breaks to promote sustained concentration and stave off mental fatigue. The Pomodoro
                Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was
                struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to
                commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato
                (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.
                <br>
                <br> <b>Pomodoro Steps: </b>
                <br>
                <br> <b>→ Step One: </b> Get a to-do list and a timer.
                <br>
                <br> <b>→ Step Two:</b> Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.
                <br>
                <br> <b>→ Step three: </b> When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.
                <br>
                <br> <b>→ Step four: </b> Then enjoy a five-minute break.
                <br>
                <br> <b>→ Step five: </b> After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.

            <!-- Time Blocking Sub-Section -->
            <dt>Time Blocking</dt>
            <dd>
                <b>Time blocking is:</b>
                <br>
                A time management method that asks you to divide your day into blocks of time. Each block is dedicated
                to accomplishing a specific task, or group of tasks, and only those specific tasks. Instead of keeping
                an open-ended to-do list of things you’ll get to as you’re able, you’ll start each day with a concrete
                schedule that lays out what you’ll work on and when. Time blocking (and its close cousins time boxing,
                task batching, and day theming) is a simple, yet effective way to take back control of your workday.
                The key to this method is <em>prioritising</em> your task list in advance - a dedicated weekly review is
                a must. Take stock of what’s coming up for the week ahead and make a rough sketch of your time blocks
                for each day. At the end of every workday, review any tasks you didn’t finish - as well as any new tasks
                that have come in - and adjust your time blocks for the rest of the week accordingly. With days that are
                time blocked in advance, you won’t have to constantly make choices about what to focus on. All you need
                to do is follow your time blocked schedule. If you get off-task or distracted, simply look at your
                schedule and get back to whichever task you blocked off time for.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Task batching is:</b><br>
                When you group similar (usually smaller) tasks together and schedule specific time blocks to complete
                all at once. By tackling similar tasks in a group, you’ll limit the amount of context switching you have
                to do throughout your day, saving precious time and mental energy. For example, scheduling two 20-minute
                blocks to process email during the day is more efficient than checking your inbox every 15 minutes. Time
                blocking pairs well with task batching because it saves you from scheduling every individual task on
                your calendar. Just block off chunks of time each day or week for when you want complete a certain batch
                of activities, e.g., email, invoicing, workouts, meetings, writing, coding, deep work, errands, meal
                prep.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Day theming is: </b>
                <br>
                A more extreme version of task batching for people who have a lot of areas of responsibility competing
                for their attention. For example, an entrepreneur often has to pay attention to marketing, sales,
                product development, customer support, and HR all at the same time. Instead of setting aside time blocks
                for each area of responsibility each day, day theming dedicates a full day each week to each
                responsibility.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Time boxing is:</b>
                <br>
                Time blocking and time boxing are often confused as being synonymous, but there's an important
                difference. Time blocking asks you to set aside certain chunks of time to focus on a given task or
                activity. For example, "I will work on a first draft of my blog post from 9 am to 11 am tomorrow."
                In contrast, time boxing asks you to impose a limit on how much time you'll dedicate to a specific task.
                Here's a time boxed version of the time blocking example above: "I will finish a first draft of my blog
                post tomorrow between 9 am and 11am."
                This self-imposed "time box" forces you to work efficiently because you have a limited amount of time in
                which to complete the task. It can be a fun way to challenge yourself and gamify your productivity.
                Cal Newport, author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, is a big proponent of
                time blocking. He dedicates 20 minutes every evening to scheduling out the next work day.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Try Time Blocking if you ...</b>
                <br><br>
                → Juggle many different projects/responsibilities
                <br> <br>
                → Spend too much time in “reactive mode”, responding to email and messages
                <br> <br>
                → Find their day chopped up by meetings
                <br> <br>
                → Battle constant interruptions throughout the day
                <br> <br>
                → Struggle to find the time and mental space for big-picture thinking
                <br> <br>
                <b>Positives of Time Blocking are: </b> <br>
                → <em>It helps you knock out “shallow work” more efficiently: </em> Shallow work is the busy work that’s
                urgent but not important to achieving your long-term goals - think paperwork or responding to (most)
                emails. When you time box shallow work, you’re setting clear limits on how much time you’ll dedicate to
                it. Plus, grouping similar tasks together reduces the cost of context switching. By batching all of your
                shallow tasks together in a dedicated time block or two, you’ll be able to power through them more
                efficiently and protect the rest of your workday for higher-impact work.
                <br> <br>
                → <em>It makes you aware of how you spend your time: </em> Most people are bad at time management. We
                are terrible at estimating how much time tasks will take, and we have a tendency to overcommit our
                future selves. Time blocking forces you to confront your current priorities and commitments and get
                intentional about how you spend your finite time. For each new commitment you let into your life, you’re
                forced to find physical space on your calendar. As a result, the opportunity cost of saying “yes”
                becomes more concrete, and it becomes much easier to say “no”.
                <br> <br>
                → <em>It counteracts perfectionism: </em> Fuzzy timelines are a perfectionist’s worst enemy. There’s
                always something to be tweaked and improved. It can be difficult to know when an open-ended project is
                finished, especially if you are aiming for perfection. At some point, you need to be able to say “good
                enough” and move on. Time boxing can help by imposing time limits on your projects. If you often prolong
                tasks by trying to get everything just right, set a strict time box for finishing the task and stick to
                it.
                <br> <br>
                → <em>It helps you follow through on your goals: </em> In the article “Beyond good intentions: Prompting
                people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks” researchers Dr. Todd Rogers and Dr.
                Katherine L. Milkman review several studies supporting the idea that “concrete plans help people follow
                through on their intentions.”

                From following an exercise regimen to scheduling a flu shot, people were more likely to act on their
                intentions when they wrote down a specific place, date, and time for the activity. Yet most people rely
                on vague intentions rather than concrete plans. The takeaway: When you schedule your tasks and goals
                you’re more likely to follow through. Time blocking forces you to make concrete plans that ensure you’re
                working toward your goals every day.

            <dt>Eat The Frog Method</dt>
            <dd>
                This famous piece of wisdom (most commonly attributed to Bill Gates) holds true over shorter time spans
                too. We tend to overestimate what we can get done in a day, but underestimate what we can accomplish in
                a year. How do we get around this quirk of human psychology? How do we make consistent progress toward
                our biggest goals without drowning day-to-day in our overly optimistic to-do lists? How do we overcome
                the mental resistance that comes with big goals and just get started? The answer is a deceptively simple
                and memorably named productivity method called <em>Eat The Frog</em>.
                <br> <br>
                Productivity consultant Brain Tracy named the Eat The Frog method after this vivid piece of advice from
                Mark Twain. While there’s more power and nuance to this method than meets the eye, it all boils down to
                this: <em>Identify one important task for the day and do it first</em>.
                <br> <br>
                <b>It promotes a deep work habit:</b>
                <br> <br>
                The most valuable work in today’s knowledge economy is almost invariably work that requires all your
                mental resources to be focused on one thing - think cognitively demanding tasks like coding, designing,
                writing, strategizing, and problem-solving. Yet the modern workplace isn’t set up to support that kind
                of distraction-free “deep work” (a phrase coined by computer science professor Cal Newport). We’re
                distracted by so many emails, meetings, chat messages and requests for input that we don’t have the time
                or space to focus on our highest impact tasks.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Eat The Frog is perfect for anyone who: </b>
                <br> <br>

            <!-- Kanban Board Sub-Section-->
            <dt>Kanban Board</dt>
            <dd>Break down complex projects using the Kanban Board, at the center of the Kanban method is the Kanban
                board. A Kanban board plots your work items as cards organized into columns that represent distinct
                phases of a project. For example, a simple Kanban board can be made up of just three columns: “to do”,
                “doing”, and “done”. You then move your cards across columns from left to right as the work item
                progresses through each phase of the project. The Kanban method was pioneered by Toyota in the 1950s as
                a way to implement "just-in-time manufacturing" and later adapated as an agile method to manage software
                development. Today, Kanban is applied to pretty much any type of work you can think of. Product teams
                use it for managing development roadmaps. Human resources uses it for recruiting and hiring. Sales teams
                use it for tracking their leads. Individuals even use “personal Kanban” for managing solo projects from
                college applications to home renovations. Unlike traditional task lists, Kanban boards make it easy to
                visually track work in progress and quickly identify what needs to happen when. While it’s particularly
                effective for collaborative projects with lots of moving parts, it can be equally effective for plotting
                out your personal goals and keeping them on track.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Kanban Board Steps: </b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>→ A Kanban board: </b>is a physical or digital space that visually represents work status with work
                items (as cards) and workflow steps (as columns).
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>→ A Kanban card: </b>represents an individual work item that needs to be completed as part of the
                bigger project. It might be a task, bug report, article, job candidate, job listing, or anything else
                that needs to pass through a process in order to be completed.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>→ Each column: </b>on the board represents a workflow step that each Kanban card must pass through
                from left to right. Simple Kanban boards are divided into three workflow steps: To Do → Doing → Done.
                However, more complex projects may have more workflow steps and use unique labels that mirror the
                chronological steps within a project.

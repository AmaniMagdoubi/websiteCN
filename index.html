    <!-- 2 - About Me -->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3 class="aboutMe"><sup>Hi, I’m Amani — </sup>a web developer, a creative & an organiser, and I aspire to empower
        others to pursue a career in Tech/ STEM</h3>
    <p>I am a Libyan-British woman and founder of <b>Aniq Coder</b>. I am passionate about Tech - as it uses both
        <em>creativity</em> and <em>logic</em> to solve world problems. I worked in the creative sector as an
        Administrator and studied Accountancy and Business Management. I decided to redirect my career at 26 years old
        by learning to code! I aspire to become a Web Developer. I believe everyone has the ability to learn to code!
    </p>
    <p>Aniq - means 'classy' in Arabic أنيق I use it as a play on the word 'unique' as we are all unique in our own way!
        I wanted this brand to include my North African / Arab / Libyan culture as it means a lot to me. </p>
